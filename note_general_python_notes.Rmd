Get current working directory
```{python}
import os
os.getcwd()
```
Using a relative path with no forward slash in the start of the path
```{python eval=FALSE}
os.chdir('images/bioinformatics') 
```

Using an absolute path, using a backslash and 'r' prefix
```{python eval=FALSE}
os.chdir(r'D:\R\Scripts')
```

Make new directory

```{python}
os.mkdir(path)
```

In Spyder, you can just use the 'Files' panel to navigate to the folder you want to use and that will become your current working directory.

# And vs &

If you are not dealing with arrays and are not performing math manipulations of integers, you probably want and.

If you have vectors of truth values that you wish to combine, use numpy with &.
