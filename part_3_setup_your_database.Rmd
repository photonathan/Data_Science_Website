# Introduction

One of my aims for this project was to create a pipeline that foregoes saving individual 'data' files (e.g. csv, xml, json, txt) to the computer and instead used a database to store the data. After reading over [this great article](https://realpython.com/python-mysql/) that gives a good overview of SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, I decided on MySQL to handle my database. A second factor in my decision was because my favorite Udemy instructor Colt Steele had a MySQL course on sale [The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/) recommend I highly recommend.

## Goal

1. Install MySQL
2. Create the Database
3. Connect Python to MySQL with SQLAlchemy
4. Connect R to MySQL using MySQL Connector/odbc follow instructions here to connect to MySQL (https://db.rstudio.com/databases/my-sql/)
    Install the odbc/MySQL connector at (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/)

. Connect MySQL to python using the MySQL Python Connector
. Install the ODBC

# Step 1: Install MySQL

I followed [these instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/installing.html) to download MySQL for my operating system (Windows). 

# Step _: Install the MySQL Python Connector

Following [these](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html) offical MySQL instructions, I downloaded the
