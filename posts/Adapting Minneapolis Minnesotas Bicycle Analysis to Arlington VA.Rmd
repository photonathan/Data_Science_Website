# Background

In 2020, Minnesota's DOT Office of Transit and Active Transportation put out a great visualization of Minneapolis' surge in bicycle and pedestrian usage soon after Minneapolis' governor Tim Walz declared a peacetime emergency on March 13, 2020 and a Stay at Home order twelve days later on March 25. Daily totals of bicycle + pedestrian counts from March 13, 2020 to May 15, 2020 were graphed against 2017-2019 daily averages.

I will be creating a analysis, changing the time frame to correspond to VA Governor Ralph Northram's State of Emergency (March 12, 2020) and Stay at Home order (March 30, 2020).
