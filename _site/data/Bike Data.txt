How has covid affected bicycling:
	Compare 2019 to 2020/2021 data
	Does the linegraph of dates corrispond to covid events like lockdown orders in arlingon
	Everyone bought bikes in 2020 (bike boom)
	Use 2021 data to make predictions/forcast
	07/09/2011 is the earliest date
	When Metro shut down, did people start walking/biking? 
		Can I easily get car traffic data?
	Normalize for population growth of the area. Add population of the area to database to easily compare.
	Normalize for weather
	
	Functionality:
		Best to save the data that was pulled to memory in case there is an error in the sql upload, you don't have to pull the data again
		UpdateSql: Finds the last date in the MySql database and pulls the data from that date to today's date
			
	Python:
		Data for each table should be a list of tuples Table 3 Weather [(Date, weather)(...)] Not sure if weather is different between locations. 
		Database using SQLite or MySQL and sqlalchemy
		web scraping
	R:
		Interative graphics/dashboards using shiny and shiny dashboard
	
	Questions:
		Do I want to use a flat file like csv as an intermediate? With large datasets, not this one, it may become slow.
		Call python from R to do the data analysis?
	
	Wishlist:
		Dockerize
		Put up a survey of different map routes on r/nova and r/arlington to see what trails people commonly use for commuting and recreation
		Host the server on AWS or one of those sites that give free hosting options: https://blog.patricktriest.com/host-webapps-free/
		Account for big news events	
	
	Bike Wrapper:
		Get counts using different requirements
		Get a list of all counters
		Maybe replace counter with Bike-O-Meter
		Get:
			Save to memory
			Save to csv, text
			Export to sql
		
	TODO:
		1. Finish python code to easily pull the past data
			a. Write a short bit of code to start at 07/09/2011 and pull the data for each counter, pull all data in 1 year increments arranged in a list of tuples
				Table1 Locations: [(Name, counterID, Lat, Long, Region, RegionID)(...)]
				Table2 Counts: [(TrailName, Date, count, direction, mode)(...)] *for hour include hour*
				Table3 Weather: [(...)] Undecided. Use built in or use weather underground
			c. Write it in a way so that anyone can use it if posted on GitHub
			d. Save the data locally as csv or something in case site goes down.
			e. Pull all data should pull up to today's date. This wont stress their server. However only add new data to database since the last pull. May need to keep a table of pull dates. How to account for pulling a date and no data uploaded yet?
		2. Put that data into a database: either SQLite (good realpython tutorial w/flask: https://realpython.com/python-sqlite-sqlalchemy) or MySQL (https://realpython.com/python-mysql/ seems to be used by businesses more)
		3. Take statistics course to know if I need to pull covid data from DC or just VA
		4a. Inital analysis of data
		4b. Write code to automatically run and update the database and then update the data.
		5. Learn more about data analysis
		6. Make sure data is analyzed properly
		7. Make a Flask app, or something simple to put data online. Maybe use google data studio? 
		8. Make predictions and put them online too
		9. Add function that imports new data into database without calling data from previous days
		10. Normalize data according to population statistics.
		11. Look at previous data and see if this increase was expected given the past years of growth
		12. Build something that can be easily changed to include different APIs or different CDC databases
	Website:
		Pull the data
		Store it in a database
		Analyze the data to look at how Covid affected biking
		See if I could predict biking trends for the summer of 2021 as people start to get vaccinated
		Why did biking increase? It is an activity you can do outside, 6 feet apart from people fairly easily. 
			A fun project where I could practice my (very) new coding skills. 
			My prediction is that the trails increased in usage but will decrease this year as people are able to do other activities like traveling or going to the gym.
		I wanted to get some experince in data analysis automation. I wanted to see if I could predict monthly cycling numbers utilizing past data.
		Bikeometer will refer to the machine performing the counting while count will refer to the number of bikers counted

annual average daily nonmotorized traffic (AADNT)
